<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A California roll is a popular sushi dish that features a delicious combination of flavors and textures. It typically consists of sushi rice rolled around fillings like imitation crab, avocado, and cucumber, all wrapped in a sheet of nori (seaweed). Often served with a sprinkle of sesame seeds or tobiko (fish roe) on the outside, the California roll is a fusion of Japanese and American culinary influences, making it a favorite among sushi lovers, especially those new to the cuisine. Its refreshing taste and vibrant colors make it an appealing choice for any sushi platter.</p> 

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>1 batch
    prepared sushi rice</li>
   <li>1 medium
    avocado (sliced into 16-20 wedges)</li>
   <li>1 small
    cucumber (seeds removed and cut into ⅕-inch strips)</li>
    <li>200 grams
        crab meat (or immitation crab)</li>
    <li>6 half sheets
        nori (4.13 inch x 7.5 inch)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon
        toasted sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make 1 batch prepared sushi rice.</li>
    <li>Prepare a small bowl of tezu by mixing a tablespoon of rice vinegar into a cup of water. If you are using a bamboo sushi mat, you'll need to wrap it in plastic wrap. If you don't have a sushi rolling mat, follow the directions above to shape your sushi without a mat. </li>
    <li>Lay one sheet of nori towards the bottom edge of the mat. Lightly wet your hands in the tezu and grab a cylinder of rice about the size of a potato. Stretch the rice cylinder from one side of the nori to the other to form a mound of rice along the top of the nori, leaving a ¼-inch border along the top.</li>
    <li>Make sure your fingers stay moist and use one hand to guide the shape of the rice along one side of the nori while you use the fingertips of your other hand to spread the mound of rice towards the bottom edge of the nori. Be careful not to smash the grains of rice.</li>
    <li>Repeat on the opposite side before spreading the rice in the center to the bottom of the nori. </li>
    <li>When your nori is evenly covered with rice, sprinkle on toasted sesame seeds.</li>
    <li>Flip the rice and nori over from top to bottom (so the nori border is closest to you)</li>
    <li>Stagger a few wedges of avocado so the thin ends overlap in the center of the nori.</li>
    <li>Place a strip of cucumber on the avocado slices. Add some pieces of crab or sticks on top of the vegetables. If you use sticks of imitation crab, you may need to split the sticks in half lengthwise to fit. Don't add too much filling, or your roll won't seal shut.</li>
    <li>To roll the sushi, tuck your thumbs under the edge of the sushi mat closest to you. Use your remaining fingers to hold the filling in place, then roll the mat up and over the filling until the rice meets the nori on the other side. Give the roll a light squeeze to adhere the rice to the nori.</li>
    <li>Hold the edge of the sushi mat and use it to continue rolling the roll so the seam is on the bottom.</li>
    <li>Now, use your forefingers to press on the top of the roll while you use your remaining fingers to press on the sides of the roll using even pressure. This will compress the rice and give your California roll its shape. </li>
    <li>To cut your California roll into slices, use your fingers to support the sides of the sushi and use a wet, sharp knife to cut it in half by pulling back on the knife and pushing forward. I don't recommend using one long stroke (like when you cut fish) because it will cause the roll to stretch.</li>
    <li>Line the halves up and then slice them into four pieces using the same technique. Serve your California roll with soy sauce, wasabi, and sushi ginger.</li>
